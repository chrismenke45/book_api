# Book API
This is the api for book tracking mobile app I am building. 
## How it's made:
Node/Express.js with TypeScript, MongoDB? Google books API? I'm still deciding
It will share data with the [front end](https://github.com/chrismenke45/book_client) built with react-native.
## Optimizations
Have my own book Database (It isn't feasable to make my own database of books but it would help the app be faster).
## Lessons Learned
This is the first time I'm using typescript with express and I expect to learn a lot.
